# Aviation-Wildlife-Strike-Severity-Research
A continual problem pertaining to aviation safety is that of bird strikes. A bird strike is strictly defined as a collision between a bird and an aircraft which is in flight or on a take off or landing roll. Acquiring knowledge concerning the factors leading to bird strikes helps to prevent such strikes from occurring as well as improving aviation safety in general. Furthermore, estimating the potential damage to an aircraft is paramount to the conservation of life on board. The severity of a bird strike can be defined as: none, minor, uncertain, substantial, or destroyed, as per the FAA Wildlife Database.
