# Aviation-Wildlife-Strike-Severity-Research
A continual problem pertaining to aviation safety is that of bird strikes. A bird strike is strictly defined as a collision between a bird and an aircraft which is in flight or on a take off or landing roll. Acquiring knowledge concerning the factors leading to bird strikes helps to prevent such strikes from occurring as well as improving aviation safety in general. Furthermore, estimating the potential damage to an aircraft is paramount to the conservation of life on board. The severity of a bird strike can be defined as: none, minor, uncertain, substantial, or destroyed, as per the FAA Wildlife Database.

# 1. Abstract

Since Leonardo da Vinciâ€™s 1485 ornithopter design, humans have expressed an inquisitive interest in observing and analyzing birds in flight as a catalyst for early aircraft design. The concept of flapping wings later induced the concept of a glide aircraft. Despite the inspiration that birds invoked to achieve human flight, they have since become a consistent safety hazard for modern day commercial, civil, and military aircraft. This project pertains to creating a predictive model to determine the level of potential damage incurred by a bird strike on an aircraft.

A continual problem pertaining to aviation safety is that of bird strikes. A bird strike is strictly defined as a collision between a bird and an aircraft which is in flight or on a take off or landing roll [1]. The term bird strike also often extends to those associated with bats and ground animals. The distinction is not significant in the scope of this research and thus they will be considered as a single entity. With a wide range of aircraft sizes, engine types, hand-in-hand with an exponential increase in air traffic, since the first U.S. commercial flight in 1914, bird strikes have become more and more prevalent. Although this is a global problem, the scope of this research focuses on the U.S. airspace, mainly because data availability is reliable and easily accessible through the FAA Wildlife Database [2].

Acquiring knowledge concerning the factors leading to bird strikes helps to prevent such strikes from occurring as well as improving aviation safety in general. Furthermore, estimating the potential damage to an aircraft is paramount to the conservation of life on board. The severity of a bird strike can be defined as: none, minor, uncertain, substantial, or destroyed, as per the FAA Wildlife Database Reference Tables. If a collision cannot be prevented, then the conservation of life on board the aircraft is of the utmost priority. Thus, there is a need for assessment of aircraft damage due to bird strikes. If the severity of damage to a civil aircraft can be estimated based on certain features then it would help to prevent severe damage bird strikes in the future. A high-level of interrogation would suggest that a contributing factor to the likely occurrence of a bird strike is that of air traffic. If it were possible to incorporate flight traffic with the already structured FAA Wildlife Strike Database then theoretically a risk factor of some sort could be induced. That is, to create a data feature that would provide a statistical measure of the likelihood of a bird streak for a given airport in the U.S. Damage to aircraft is categorized as per the FAA shown in Figure 1.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been responsible for the collection of and maintenance of bird strike data within the United States since 1990. Strike data is voluntarily entered into the FAA Wildlife Strike Database. Consequently, the information publicly available only concerns those that have been received by the FAA from airlines, airports, pilots, and other sources. It is in the best interest of all aforementioned parties to document such bird strikes as to provide enough data for research to be conducted in order to prevent airstrikes and enhance aviation safety as a whole. However, the FAA records must be viewed with a conservative approach because the bird strike logs are voluntary and not mandated. However, it is reasonable to assume that the logged data is true and no false bird strikes have been reported considering the niche of these occurrences. Although there is a clear skewed distribution amongst the damage level caused by bird strikes, it is imperative to correctly predict the occurrences in which damage is minor, substantial, or destroyed for the preservation of life as well as the structural health of the aircraft. 

Bird strikes have existed since the birth of aviation. Average bird strikes range between 2.83 and 8.19 per 10,000 aircraft movements in civil aviation, depending on the country [3]. Smaller civil aircraft are more susceptible to severe damage depending on the extent of the strike. Conversely, larger aircraft, such as turbofan aircraft, are subject to loss in thrust upon collision. Bird strikes were determined to have caused 618 hull losses and 534 fatalities from the beginning of aviation through until 11 November 2019 [3].
For smaller aircraft, significant damage may be caused to the aircraft structure and all aircraft, especially jet-engined ones, are vulnerable to the loss of thrust which can follow the ingestion of birds into engine air intakes. This has resulted in a number of fatal accidents.
Bird strikes may occur during any phase of flight but are most likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach and landing phases due to the greater numbers of birds in flight at lower levels. Since most birds fly mainly during the day, most bird strikes occur in daylight hours as well. This project pertains to creating a predictive model that is capable of estimating the occurrence of a bird strike. Furthermore, the project aims to incorporate flight traffic data for airports in the U.S. to impute a risk factor feature.
